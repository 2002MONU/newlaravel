Dear  ma'am good morning,

I hope this email finds you well. I am writing to request a 17-day work-from-home arrangement, starting from [14-10-2024] to [02-11-2024], coinciding with the Diwali festival. I would like to spend quality time with my family during this auspicious occasion and require the flexibility to work remotely.

As my hometown is approximately 2000 kilometers away, it takes around 40 hours to reach, making it a significant journey. Therefore, I would like to utilize this opportunity to work from home and be with my loved ones during the festive season.

I will ensure that my work responsibilities are completed, and my productivity remains unaffected. I will be available via email, phone, and video conferencing during regular working hours.

Please let me know if this arrangement is feasible, and if there are any additional requirements or checks I need to complete.

Thank you for considering my request.

Best regards,

Monu Kumar
